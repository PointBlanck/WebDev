        <h1>Greatest Video Games of All Time</h1>
        <h2>These are the greatest videogames ever made<br>
            (according to Theodosios Kavalagios)</h2>
            
            <h3>Metal Gear Solid Franchise</h3>
            <p>The Metal Gear franchise, created by Hideo Kojima,
                is a landmark in gaming history, blending tactical
                stealth gameplay with dense, often surreal narratives
                about war, control, and identity. Beginning in the 1980s
                and evolving into cinematic epics like Metal Gear Solid
                and Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, the series is
                known for pushing hardware to its limits while subverting
                player expectations. Kojima&#039;s storytelling combines
                political intrigue with science fiction and metafiction,
                delivering iconic characters like Solid Snake, Big Boss,
                and Revolver Ocelot. While Metal Gear Solid V offered
                unmatched gameplay flexibility, the series remains unfinished
                due to Kojima&#039;s departure from Konami — leaving fans with
                both a legendary legacy and an air of mystery.</p>

            <h3>Resident Evil Franchise</h3>
            <p>Resident Evil redefined horror in video games and has
                continuously reinvented itself to stay relevant. The
                early titles established the survival horror genre
                with resource management, claustrophobic environments,
                and grotesque enemies. Resident Evil 4 revolutionized
                third-person action games with its over-the-shoulder
                perspective and set-piece intensity, while Resident Evil 7
                returned the series to its terrifying roots through a bold
                first-person perspective. Capcom&#039;s modern remakes of
                Resident Evil 2 and 3 masterfully balance nostalgia with
                modern mechanics, showcasing the series&#039; adaptability.
                Though occasionally uneven (Resident Evil 6 being the low
                point for many), the franchise remains one of the most
                influential in gaming.</p>

            <h3>Batman Arkham Franchise</h3>
            <p>The Batman: Arkham series elevated superhero
                games to a new standard, delivering a blend of immersive
                storytelling, fluid combat, and rich environmental design.
                Arkham Asylum introduced the perfect formula: a tight,
                Metroidvania-style world, intelligent enemy design, and
                Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill&#039;s unforgettable voice work.
                Arkham City expanded on this with a larger, open-world Gotham
                that maintained a strong narrative core, while Arkham Knight
                pushed technical boundaries — even if the Batmobile segments
                drew mixed reactions. Rocksteady&#039; attention to character depth,
                stealth mechanics, and environmental storytelling made players
                feel like the Dark Knight in a way no other game had before.
                The series remains the benchmark for superhero adaptations in
                gaming.</p>


            <h2>Honorable Mentions</h2>
            <h3>Undertale</h3>
            <p>Undertale, created almost entirely by Toby Fox,
                is a masterclass in subverting RPG expectations while
                telling a deeply emotional, surprisingly philosophical story.
                Its retro aesthetic and minimalist design belie a game rich
                with branching narratives, fourth-wall-breaking moments,
                and moral complexity. What sets Undertale apart is its core
                mechanic: the choice to spare or kill — and how that choice
                changes the story, characters, and even the game itself.
                The writing is sharp, witty, and touching, with characters
                like Sans, Papyrus, and Toriel becoming cultural icons.
                Whether played as a pacifist, a murderer, or something in
                between, Undertale offers a uniquely personal journey,
                proving that indie games can leave an impact just as lasting
                as blockbuster titles.</p>
    
            <h3>Dead Space</h3>
            <p>The original Dead Space is a near-perfect blend of survival
                horror and sci-fi action, setting a new bar for atmosphere
                and tension in the genre. Set aboard the derelict USG Ishimura,
                the game traps players in a haunting, blood-streaked maze of
                corridors filled with grotesque necromorphs. Its “strategic
                dismemberment” system forced players to think tactically,
                while the diegetic UI (health bar and ammo displayed on
                protagonist Isaac Clarke&#039;s suit) enhanced immersion. Dead Space
                borrowed wisely from influences like Alien and Resident Evil 4
                but created something uniquely terrifying through its sound design,
                environmental storytelling, and sustained dread. It remains a
                landmark title in horror gaming and a prime example of how
                gameplay and atmosphere can work in perfect sync.</p>

            <h3>Half-Life</h3>
            <p>Half-Life, developed by Valve, revolutionized first-person
                shooters by placing story and immersion at the forefront
                without ever taking control away from the player. As
                theoretical physicist Gordon Freeman, players descend into
                the chaos of the Black Mesa facility after a disastrous
                experiment tears open a rift to another dimension. The game&#039;s
                seamless level transitions, environmental puzzles, and AI-driven
                enemies broke new ground in 1998, and its influence is still felt
                today. Half-Life told its story organically — through the world,
                the environment, and the unfolding disaster — instead of cutscenes,
                redefining narrative structure in games. Its legacy was only
                strengthened by its groundbreaking sequel, Half-Life 2, but the original
                stands as one of the most important and influential games ever made.</p>
