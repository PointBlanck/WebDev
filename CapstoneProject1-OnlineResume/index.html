        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <!-- Ideally it should be changed in the future -->
        <p>Dedicated to acquiring more knowledge and more skills,
            I am an organized and driven individual who knows how
            to prioritize, plan strategically and execute.
            I approach every goal with patience and persistence
            while focusing on the quality of the outcome. I love to learn
            more on how I can improve myself, be more efficient and capable.
            At the end of the day, I aim to be a better, more well rounded
            version of myself.
