        <h1>About the Author</h1>
        <p>I'm a multilingual physicist and developer with a passion for building and understanding
            complex systems—whether through code, circuits, or theory. My journey spans from full-stack
            web development to low-level Assembly programming, with Python, MATLAB, and Mathematica as my
            daily companions. I&#x27;m just as comfortable writing backend APIs as I am simulating physical
            systems or automating lab setups. Electronics is more than a hobby for me; it's where abstract logic
            meets physical reality. I love designing and experimenting with custom circuits, bringing together
            the tangible and the theoretical in a way that always keeps me learning.</p>

        <p>My background in Physics—particularly in Optoelectronics, Lasers, Nuclear Physics, and Elementary
            Particles—shapes the way I approach both problems and creativity. I thrive in environments where I'm
            surrounded by tools, components, equations, and ideas, often mid-experiment with a soldering iron in
            one hand and a notebook or terminal in the other. I'm not one to pose for the camera; I&#x27;d rather
            be captured deep in thought or mid-project, immersed in the process. For me, science, code, and hardware
            aren&#x27;t separate interests—they&#x27;re parts of the same system I&#x27;ve been exploring since I first
            fell in love with how the universe works.</p>
