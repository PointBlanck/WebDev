<!-- Personal Site Project -->
<!--
This project is initiated as a Capstone Project for
Angela Yu's Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp.
It is meant to serve my future needs and will probably have
its own custom domain online in the future. The things I would
like to put up on it are:
- Drawings
- Projects
- Animations
- Video Edits
- Games
- Physics Videos
- Monthly Journal
- Solutions to the Exercises I am going to solve
This is a completely original site with no CSS or Javascript frameworks involved.
It is meant to serve as my first steps in Web Development as well as a sort of
'Archive' for everything I have worked on and am proud of. Hopefully in a few short
years, it will be filled with lots of interesting projects, DIY, animation and
interactive media as well as my autobiography and even Physics Explanatory Videos.

This is a lot of work so I would really like to see how it will all turn out in
the future! <3
